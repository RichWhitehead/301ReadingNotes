# Read: 10 - THE CALL STACK

## What is call stack?

- Call stack is what a program uses to keep track of method calls. The call stack is made up of stack frames—one for each method call.

## What's usually stored in a stack?

- Local variables
- Arguments passed into the method
- Information about the caller's stack frame
- The return address—what the program should do after the function returns.

## Types of error messages 

- Reference errors - When the varibles is not yet declared

- Syntax errors - Occurs when something that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax.

- Range errors - When a objet is manipulated with some kind of a length you get this type of error.

- Debugging is the easiest way to and most common way to check and find bugs in your code(console.log();).

## Handling errors

- `Try` to `catch` errors can usually be used to fallback to a default state.
