# Reading 13: Sending Form Data

The form-data can be sent as URL variables (with method="get") or as HTTP post transaction (with method="post").

## The "GET" Method

- Appends form-data into the URL in name/value pairs.

- The length of a URL is limited.

- Never use GET to send sensitive data.

- Useful for form submissions where a user wants to bookmark the result.

- GET is better for non-secure data, like query strings in Google.

## The "POST" Method

- Appends form-data inside the body of the HTTP request.

- Has no size limitations.

- Form submissions with POST cannot be bookmarked.
