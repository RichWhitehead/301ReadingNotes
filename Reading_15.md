# Readings 15: DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION


- Tech has a diversity problem. At the biggest tech companies in the United States, nobody seems to know how to meaningfully increase staff diversity. If they did, we wouldn’t see such abysmal rates of growth among minority employees at major tech companies — for instance, the percent of Black hires overall rose by only 0.7% at Google in 2018, 0.1% at Microsoft in 2018, and 0.3% at Facebook in 2019.

## Remember there is a difference between equity and equality

- Equality is where each person gets a block of the same size to stand on to see over the fence. The smallest person still cannot see over the fence.
Equity is where each person gets a block that allows them to see over the fence. The smallest person gets the largest block, and ultimately all three people are at the same height.

- The systemic barrier is removed when the cause of the inequity is removed altogether and the fence is taken down.

- The final example is the ultimate goal, but in lieu of that, equity is the goal over equality. You should not be treating all your employees exactly the same. Instead, you should be treating your employees slightly differently based on needs. This might take the form of different pay structures or more support for those who do not come from “traditional” tech backgrounds, but however it looks it’s important that it exists.
